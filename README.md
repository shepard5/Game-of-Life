# Game-of-Life---John-Conway
Simulation with code of John Conway's Game of Life - Editable Parameters

Just for fun wanted to see how difficult it would be to code The Game of Life in python. Below is a screen recording of the final product. With the code provided, the game initializes with a random array of 'alive' and 'dead' cells. Array dimensions can be changed under the array class and simulation playback speed can be changed at the bottom in the matplotlib animation (interval = 50 indicating 50 ms per frame). Not optimized for efficiency.
